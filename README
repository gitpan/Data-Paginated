NAME
    Data::Paginated - paginate a list of data

SYNOPSIS
            my $paginator = Data::Paginated->new({
                    entries => \@my_list,
                    entries_per_page => $entries_per_page, 
                    current_page => $current_page,
            });

            my @to_print = $paginator->page_data;

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Paginated is a thin wrapper around Data::Pageset which adds the
    extra functionality of being able to get all the entries from a list
    that are on a given page.

METHODS
  new
            my $paginator = Data::Paginated->new({
                    entries => \@my_list,
                    entries_per_page => $entries_per_page,
                    current_page => $current_page,
            });

    This can take all the arguments that can be passed to Data::Pageset,
    with the exception that instead of passing simply the total number of
    items in question, you actually pass the items as a reference.

  page_data
            my @to_print = $paginator->page_data;

    This returns a list of the entries that will be on the current page.

    So, if you have a list of [ 1 .. 10 ], 3 entries per page, and current
    page is 2, this will return (4, 5, 6).
